# POSTMAN-task
I have used the following models in the task-
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. SVM

The Linear Regression model has a large mean root error due to the inability in handling imbalanced data and complex relationships. 
Upon evaluating the following models on accuracy, spped and memory usage Logistic Regression serves as the best model amongst the provided models.
